Hello! 
Below is how you use the model:
1. The model requires 3 data to train, which is allData.txt (Prob. Calc.), good.txt, and bad.txt (Thresh. Calc.)
2. In the model.py files I have commented on the changable parameters i.e training data and etc., and also how to train the data.
3. The modelTest.py requires the probability model and threshold values from model.py and also testing data, which in this case uses the csv. given by Mr. Fahrell.
4. The modelTest.py returns a dictionary that contains all the words and their respective class predictions.
